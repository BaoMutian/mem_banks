Your goal is to complete tasks by interacting with objects and navigating through rooms.\n\n==================================================\nENVIRONMENT RULES\n==================================================\n1. You can only carry ONE object at a time\n2. Use exact object names with numbers (e.g., \"apple 1\", \"fridge 1\")\n\n==================================================\nAVAILABLE COMMANDS\n==================================================\nNavigation:\n  - look                          : View current surroundings\n  - go to [receptacle]            : Move to a location (e.g., \"go to fridge 1\")\n\nObject Manipulation:\n  - take [object] from [receptacle] : Pick up an object (e.g., \"take apple 1 from fridge 1\")\n  - move [object] to [receptacle]   : Place object (e.g., \"move apple 1 to fridge 1\")\n  - open [receptacle]               : Open a container (e.g., \"open fridge 1\")\n  - close [receptacle]              : Close a container\n\nObject Processing:\n  - heat [object] with [receptacle] : Heat with microwave (e.g., \"heat egg 1 with microwave 1\")\n  - cool [object] with [receptacle] : Cool with fridge (e.g., \"cool apple 1 with fridge 1\")\n  - clean [object] with [receptacle]: Clean with sink (e.g., \"clean mug 1 with sinkbasin 1\")\n  - use [object]                    : Use/toggle object (e.g., \"use desklamp 1\")\n\nUtility:\n  - inventory                      : Check what you're carrying\n  - examine [object]               : Look at object details\n  - check valid actions            : List all currently valid actions\n\n\n==================================================\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE FROM SIMILAR TASKS\n==================================================\nBelow are experiences from past interactions that may help with your current task.\nUse them as reference when relevant, but adapt to the specific situation.\n\n[Experience #1] (Similarity: 1.00, Result: SUCCESS)\n  Goal: Your task is to: put two soapbottle in toilet.\n  Actions taken:\n  > --- Trajectory 1 (SUCCESS) ---\n  > go to countertop 1\n  > take soapbottle 1 from countertop 1\n  ... (105 more steps) ...\n  > go to toilet 1\n  > check valid actions\n  > move soapbottle 3 to toilet 1\n  Key Insights:\n    - Pick and Place Strategy: Efficiently pick and place objects by first locating them and then moving them to the target location.\n      To successfully complete the task of placing two soapbottles in the toilet, first locate the soapbottles on the countertop. Pick up one soapbottle, move it to the toilet, then repeat the process for the second soapbottle. Ensure that you are at the correct location before attempting to move the object.\n    - Use Inventory to Track Carried Objects: Check the inventory to confirm which objects are being carried to avoid confusion.\n      Regularly check the inventory to confirm which objects are being carried. This helps in verifying that the correct object is being moved and prevents errors when attempting to place multiple objects in the target location.\n    - Check Valid Actions for Movement: Verify valid actions before attempting to move an object to ensure the action is possible.\n      Before attempting to move an object, check the list of valid actions to confirm that the move is possible. This avoids wasted steps and ensures that the action is executed correctly.\n    - Navigate Efficiently Between Locations: Move directly between locations to minimize steps and avoid unnecessary detours.\n      Navigate directly between the countertop and the toilet to minimize steps. This reduces the number of actions needed and improves efficiency when handling multiple objects.\n    - Handle Multiple Object Pickup: Pick up one object at a time to avoid carrying limitations and ensure successful placement.\n      Pick up one soapbottle at a time to ensure that the agent is carrying only one object. This avoids carrying limitations and ensures that each object can be moved and placed correctly.\n\n[Experience #2] (Similarity: 0.91, Result: SUCCESS)\n  Goal: Your task is to: put two spraybottle in toilet.\n  Actions taken:\n  > --- Trajectory 1 (SUCCESS) ---\n  > go to cabinet 1\n  > open cabinet 1\n  ... (131 more steps) ...\n  > take spraybottle 1 from countertop 1\n  > go to toilet 1\n  > move spraybottle 1 to toilet 1\n  Key Insights:\n    - Verify Object Availability Before Attempting to Take: Ensure the object is present and accessible before attempting to take it.\n      Before attempting to take an object, check if it is visible and accessible in the current location. If the object is not present, navigate to the correct location or check other receptacles.\n    - Use the Move Command for Placing Objects: Place objects in their target location using the move command.\n      Once an object is in hand, use the move command to transfer it to the desired receptacle. Ensure you are at the target location before attempting to move the object.\n    - Check Valid Actions for Efficient Navigation: Use the check valid actions command to understand available options and reduce unnecessary steps.\n      Before proceeding with an action, check valid actions to confirm available commands and avoid repeating steps or trying invalid actions.\n    - Navigate to the Target Location Before Moving: Ensure you are at the target location before attempting to move an object there.\n      Before moving an object to a receptacle, navigate to that receptacle to avoid failed moves and ensure the action is executed correctly.\n    - Manage Inventory Carefully: Keep track of what you are carrying to avoid confusion and ensure you have the correct object for the task.\n      Regularly check your inventory to confirm you are carrying the correct object. If you are carrying an object, avoid taking additional objects that may interfere with the task.\n\n==================================================\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n==================================================\nYou MUST respond in EXACTLY this format:\n\nThink: <your reasoning about the current situation and what to do next>\n\nAction: <exact command from the list above>\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Always include both \"Think:\" and \"Action:\" sections\n- The action must be a valid command with exact object/receptacle names\n- If stuck, use \"check valid actions\" to see available options\n\n==================================================\nEXAMPLE DEMONSTRATIONS\n==================================================\nThe following examples show how to complete various tasks:\n\nExample 1: \n\nYou are in the middle of a room.
